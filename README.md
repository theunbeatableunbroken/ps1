# ps1
code for the ps1 
This repository contains the perception and path-planning stack developed for the Stark Industries PS1 Challenge. The system is designed to navigate a 20X20 grid across three different environments (Lab, Forest, and Desert)1. 
Project Overview :localized EMP has crippled Stark Industries' autonomous logistics network.
This project rebuilds the capability to:
    Identify Terrain: Categorize maps into Lab, Forest, or Desert themes.
    Classify Tiles: Decode 400 grid cells into classes: Path, Wall, Hazard, Start, or Goal 
    Optimize Pathing: Compute a move sequence (l, r, u, d) that minimizes total cost by leveraging "Velocity Boosts" . 
Technical Methodology. Perception & ClassificationSince the underlying class grid is hidden, we use a prototype-based classification approach6666:+1Feature Extraction: Each tile is represented by the Mean and Standard Deviation of its RGB channels.Terrain Recognition: We use K-Means clustering to distinguish between the three environment themes based on global image features.Nearest-Neighbor Decoding: Tiles are classified by matching their features to the closest class prototype within the identified terrain type.B. Movement Cost ModelThe system calculates the cost of every move to ensure energy efficiency7.Base Costs: Each terrain has a unique cost structure for traversal888888888:+2ClassLabForestDesert0 (Path)1.0 91.5 101.2 112 (Hazard)3.0 122.8 133.7 143 (Start)1.0 151.5 161.2 174 (Goal)2.0 182.5 192.2 201 (Wall)$\infty$ 21$\infty$$\infty$Boost Integration: The final cost of moving into a cell $(i, j)$ is:$step\_cost(i,j) = base\_cost(i,j) - boost(i,j)$22.C. Path PlanningWe utilize Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the near-optimal sequence of 4-connected steps23232323. The algorithm ignores Class 1 (Walls) and prioritizes the lowest accumulated $step\_cost$ to reach the Goal tile24242424.+43. Repository Structuretrain/: Contains 20 labeled maps, class grids, and velocity boost files used for training 25.test/: Contains the evaluation map images and boost JSON files26.solution.py: The main inference script that identifies terrain, decodes the grid, and runs the Dijkstra planner.submission.csv: The final output containing image_id and the move sequence (path) 27.4. How to RunEnvironment: Ensure you have Python 3.x, OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn installed.Execution: Run the script to process test images and generate the submission file
